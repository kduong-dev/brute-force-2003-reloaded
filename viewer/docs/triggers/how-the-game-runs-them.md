## How the game runs them

* **Events.** An event is {signal, the sender's `iD`, a subject object, data} (0x14 bytes,
  vtable 0x3a3fb4). A trigger sends to its targets only while it's enabled and not dead
  (FUN_001ff0a0). An object (a character, a world button, a pickup, a spawn's copy) sends to the
  triggers that list it among their objects (FUN_001fe3d0). `h_0884288c` is the editor's
  back-reference list: read and dropped.
* **Entries** (`<h_031cd9f5>`: `<base Type signal action match-id h_170a9b80 h_f136d22d
  h_e2da3955>`, alone or inside an `<anim>`, `<calculator value>` or `<script>`). A trigger
  answers an event with its entries in order whose signal and match-id are the event's and
  whose use count (h_e2da3955, 0 in the data) is under their limit (h_f136d22d: 1 once,
  2147483647 always) (FUN_001feb60). The match is exact: the data's "any" entries (signal -1)
  never match; the routers that have them pass everything without reading their entries.
* **An entry acting** counts a use (FUN_001feac0). Spent with h_170a9b80, or any entry acting
  with h_137926ff, the trigger sends DISABLED to its targets and disables itself. Enabling a
  trigger zeroes all its entries' counts (0x1fefc0).
* **After an event** other than FIRST_UPDATE (its own handling of one, or a send), h_f657f799
  kills the trigger (it never acts or sends again) and h_1eec0e75 disables it, once each
  (FUN_001ff000). The DESTROYED / DISABLED they send then is lost: the trigger is off by then.
* **The base's actions** (every class, FUN_001ff0f0): ENABLE (ENABLED to the targets), DISABLE,
  TOGGLE_ENABLE, and USER_SIG1-8 (USER_SIGNAL1-8 to the targets, while enabled). A DISABLE's own
  DISABLED is lost the same way. A disabled trigger runs only these.
* **FIRST_UPDATE** (13): each enabled trigger's first update sends it to the trigger itself,
  once (FUN_001fe610 / FUN_001fe660); one disabled at the start gets it on its first update once
  enabled. Before that, the level's start sends it to every script-trigger and runs its update
  (FUN_001fe260), so an enabled script-trigger gets it twice (the tutorial's opening one logs two
  OPERATEs; its script starts once: [cutscenes.md](../cutscenes.md)).
