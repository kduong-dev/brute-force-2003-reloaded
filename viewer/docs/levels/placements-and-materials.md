*Part of [levels/](README.md), the former page `levels.md`.*

* A level `<transform>` is a 3 × 3 rotation followed by the position. The rotation's columns are
  the object's axes; read that way, the level's cameras come out level and looking down −z.
* Object types map to mesh archetypes through objecttypes (`mesh-name` beside the type's
  `<base name>`). Material types h_02dca948 and h_1c5f7aab are alpha-tested (grass, fences,
  grates, signs, cables); the rest use texture alpha for shine.
* Material type h_0e7658e4 is the glow shader: a colour texture (its alpha a shine mask) plus a
  glow texture (`h_e01baa40`) drawn as emissive. That's what lights the ceiling light strips in
  Bulgar's buildings and the lava cracks in sdm_m07's and sdm_e13's rock. It used to be treated
  as alpha-tested, which cut the rock into floating dark flakes.
